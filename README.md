## Where colorfull Cubes meets 3-Dimentional Art

The groundbreaking inter-locking cubes that redefine how we build.
Explore symmetry, engineer 3D structures, and strengthen problem-solving skills — all through hands-on play

## What is QBLOX?

Qblox is a construction toy made of 4cm snap-together cubes in nine vibrant colors. Each cube connects horizontally, vertically, and diagonally through symmetrical channels, creating structural possibilities that traditional building toys can't match.

Designed for ages 3 and up, Qblox grows with every hand that builds. A preschooler learns to stack. An elementary student engineers structures. A teenager creates architectural art. A grandparent discovers patterns alongside grandchildren. It's play that connects generations.

## How Qblox Stands Out
- **Supports STEM-Oriented Thinking**: As children grow, Qblox introduces real 3D reasoning: how shapes connect, how balance works, and how design choices affect the structure. It gives them early exposure to the type of thinking used in engineering.
- **Helps Young Kids Practice Hand Skills**: The large cubes are simple to grab and connect. They encourage young children to use both hands together, improving coordination, precision, and confidence while building.
- **Encourages Collaborative Play**: Qblox allows several people to work on the same model from different sides. It fits naturally into classrooms, therapy environments, and family settings where building becomes a shared activity.
- **Three-Direction Connection System**: Each cube connects in three perpendicular directions, enabling stable 3D structures that can extend outward and upward. This capability distinguishes Qblox from standard blocks or magnetic tiles.

## Getting started with QBLOX
Lets slowly unpack Qblox's endless possibilities with the most basic building blocks

- **The Qube**: Begin your building journey with simple shapes that unlock big ideas.
- **The Spinning top**: Start with a single Qube and snap one onto each open side — suddenly you’ve engineered your very own spinning top!
- **The Tower**: You’ve mastered the spinning top — now stack another one right on top. Just like that, you’ve built your first Tower! how tall can it get?
- **The Twins**: Stacking straight up is fun… but let’s go bigger.Take two Towers and connect them together — side-by-side.Look at that — you’ve just built The Twins


### Cubes May Separate, But They Don’t Break
To ensure safety and long-term reuse, every cube is built from three strong parts that can detach under impact instead of cracking. Just reconnect the pieces and continue building. A quick rebuild guide is available whenever help is needed.

## Q&A
### What age is Qblox designed for?

Qblox is safe for children as young as 3, thanks to jumbo 4cm cubes with no small parts. But it engages all ages—from preschoolers learning to balance cubes, to teens and adults exploring complex patterns. It's truly multi-generational play.

### How do the cubes connect?

Each cube has symmetrical channels that allow them to snap together horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. The connections are strong enough to hold structures together during play, yet gentle enough for small fingers to connect and disconnect easily.

### What if a cube comes apart?

Each cube is made from three identical parts that snap together. If one comes apart—from a drop or rough play—it's easy to reassemble. This teaches children how structures are built from the inside out and introduces basic micro-engineering concepts. We provide a rebuild tutorial video for guidance.

### How do I clean Qblox cubes?

Simply wipe with a damp cloth and mild soap if needed. The durable plastic is easy to maintain and designed for years of play.

### Can Qblox be used in classrooms?

Absolutely. Qblox is a hands-on STEM learning tool that supports spatial reasoning lessons, engineering challenges, collaborative problem-solving, and Montessori-style open-ended exploration. Many educators use it for both structured activities and free-build time.

### What's included in each set?

QBLOX-18 includes 18 cubes (2 of each color in 9 vibrant colors) plus an instruction guide. QBLOX-27 includes 27 cubes (3 of each color) plus an instruction guide. Both sets come with links to online video tutorials and building inspiration.

### Where can I buy Qblox?

Qblox is available on Amazon with fast shipping. Use the 'Get Qblox' buttons on this page to view both set options and current availability.

### Is Qblox safe?

Yes. Qblox meets international safety standards including ASTM certification. The jumbo 4cm cube size eliminates choking hazards, and all materials are non-toxic and durable. Designed with safety as a priority from day one.
