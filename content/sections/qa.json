      "question": "What age is Qblox designed for?",
      "answer": "Qblox is safe for children as young as 3, thanks to jumbo 4cm cubes with no small parts. But it engages all ages—from preschoolers learning to balance cubes, to teens and adults exploring complex patterns. It's truly multi-generational play."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do the cubes connect?",
      "answer": "Each cube has symmetrical channels that allow them to snap together horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. The connections are strong enough to hold structures together during play, yet gentle enough for small fingers to connect and disconnect easily."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if a cube comes apart?",
      "answer": "Each cube is made from three identical parts that snap together. If one comes apart—from a drop or rough play—it's easy to reassemble. This teaches children how structures are built from the inside out and introduces basic micro-engineering concepts. We provide a rebuild tutorial video for guidance."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I clean Qblox cubes?",
      "answer": "Simply wipe with a damp cloth and mild soap if needed. The durable plastic is easy to maintain and designed for years of play."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Qblox be used in classrooms?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Qblox is a hands-on STEM learning tool that supports spatial reasoning lessons, engineering challenges, collaborative problem-solving, and Montessori-style open-ended exploration. Many educators use it for both structured activities and free-build time."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's included in each set?",
      "answer": "QBLOX-18 includes 18 cubes (2 of each color in 9 vibrant colors) plus an instruction guide. QBLOX-27 includes 27 cubes (3 of each color) plus an instruction guide. Both sets come with links to online video tutorials and building inspiration."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where can I buy Qblox?",
      "answer": "Qblox is available on Amazon with fast shipping. Use the 'Get Qblox' buttons on this page to view both set options and current availability."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Qblox safe?",
      "answer": "Yes. Qblox meets international safety standards including ASTM certification. The jumbo 4cm cube size eliminates choking hazards, and all materials are non-toxic and durable. Designed with safety as a priority from day one."
