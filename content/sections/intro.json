  "content": [
    "Qblox is a construction toy made of 4cm snap-together cubes in nine vibrant colors. Each cube connects horizontally, vertically, and diagonally through symmetrical channels, creating structural possibilities that traditional building toys can't match.",
    "Designed for ages 3 and up, Qblox grows with every hand that builds. A preschooler learns to stack. An elementary student engineers structures. A teenager creates architectural art. A grandparent discovers patterns alongside grandchildren. It's play that connects generations."
